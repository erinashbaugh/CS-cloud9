        <h2>District Letter</h2>
        <p>Over 750,000 students in the U.S. from age 12-18 have experienced a crime. Many of these students have little to no self-defense knowledge and because of this, an attacker sees them as an easy target, also an attacker looks for a person with low self esteem who is more likely to give up in an attack. I propose a self defense class can lead to the safety of many kids. This class can be either an Elective, or in place of PE. This class would consist of a way to boost a person's self-confidence, how to stand up in an attack, hand to hand combat, survival skills, and what to keep on them in case of an attack. This class can fulfill the PE requirements of running and defense skills. This class would need the funds of an experienced self-defense teacher, equipment; dummies, mats, hand guards, and a protection suit for the “attacker”. Self-defense can also lower the rate of bullying at our school, many think that with the knowledge of self-defense, people will take advantage of fighting with skills, but many forget that the student being attacked now has the self-confidence to stand up for themselves.

<p>Five out of six North Americans will be victims in a violent crime. Many parents, teachers, and students are willing to partake in a self-defense class. A person cannot become their full self until they develop self-confidence and are secure in their envirovent. Self-defense is not only for the physical need but to boost the mental state. Self-defense is to make a person more aware of their surroundings and to not hesitate or freeze in danger. Males are mainly victims of strangers while most women are victims from a friend, partener, or relative. One in three teenagers have experienced violence through dating.

<p>Women between the ages of 16 and 24 are at the greatest risk of violence. To avoid violence, people should always make logical decisions. A skill all women should posses is that of self-defense. Always be on guard and know that the attacker pick a person for their weak state and the attacker has the advantage. Always maintain control and put a stop to their fear. By stepping into the attack move the victim reduces the force of the hit and catches the attacker off guard. When hit in the head, keep the jaw tight to keep from going unconscious. A person without training should never use a fist punch but rather hit with the palm of their hand.</p></font>

<p>Modern self-defense is not any particular kind of style, it is using different kinds of technique to keep people safe out on the streets. Many self-defense classes are taught by professionals who are masters in martial arts with years of experience. Self-defense helps with physical achievement such as coordinations, flexibility, and balance, as well as mental achievements such as discipline and self-confidence. Many skills in a martial arts class are not convenient on the streets because they could leave you open and vulnerable or off balanced. Many colleges provide a self-defense class and are constantly full and have success. When a woman is assaulted by a man the men do not typically throw punches, but surround the women and force them to the ground.

<p>It is reported that 1 out of 10 middle school aged student is bullied weekly. There has to be a balance between tolerance to a bully and knowing when to take action. Physical contact is to be used as a last resort and students should learn how to defend themselves without the need to strike. Self-defense can improve awareness, self discipline, physical skills, hands on experience, the ability to fight back, self-confidence, communication skills, fitness, and mental strategies. Physical education programs are becoming more common because of the high rate of violence. Many schools do not offer a class because the teachers fear the class will cause more violence on school grounds. If self-defense is taught properly the violence rate will go down instead. Many students will act like they know what they are doing in a self-defense class, while others may become shy.

<p>When a student learns self-defense for the first time, their fear of being attacked might go up, this is a temporary stage, but it helps the student to be aware of their surroundings and have an advantage of being on the lookout. Many people do not take a self-defense class because they believe they will never become a victim to an attack.

<p>A person who learns self-defense becomes more aware and can help identify and prevent an act of crime. Over 750,000 students in the U.S. from age 12-18 have experienced a crime. Teaching students to fight reduces the amount of fighting at a school. A student has to have confidence when learning self-defense. One out of ten middle schoolers have experienced bullying. Self-defense teaches fitness and other physical skills, self discipline, and encourages self-confidence.</p></font>
