               Books are really fun too read. They make life interesting and give you something to do. There are different kinds of books to read. There is mystery, fiction, real events, and action books. Some books are long while others
               are short. There are picture books and some without any pictures. Many people do not like to read, but that is because they havent found a book, author, or type of book they like. Some think of reading as informative reading
               like out of a textbook. Reading for fun is not like that. You find an interesting book and read it when you have time. When you give reading a chance you will find that it is really fun.
